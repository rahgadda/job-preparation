# Langchain
- It is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using `Large Language Models (LLMs)`. 

## Overview
- 

## History
- LangChain was launched in `October 2022` as an open source project by Harrison Chase, while working at machine learning startup Robust Intelligence

## Modules
- `langchain-core`: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language
- `langchain-community`: Third party integrations and partner packages that only rely on langchain-core.
- `langchain`: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
- `LangGraph`: A library for building robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph.
- `LangSmith`: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain.
- `LangServe`: A library for deploying LangChain chains as REST APIs.
