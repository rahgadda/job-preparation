# Python

## Overview
- Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive, dynamically typed, functional & object-oriented programming language.
- Python is an open-source and cross-platform programming language.
- Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, data visualisation and Machine learning.

## History
- Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.
- Language was named after a popular comedy series `Monty Python's Flying Circus` on BBC.
- There are two major release of Python `2.x.x` & `3.x.x`. Python 3.0, a completely revamped version of Python was released in December 2008. It was revamped to remove a lot of discrepancies that had crept in Python 2.x versions.
